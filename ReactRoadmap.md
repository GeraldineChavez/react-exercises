# React Fundamentals:

### 1. Components: 
Understand the concept of components, their lifecycle, and how to compose them to build UIs.

- JSX: Learn how to use JSX syntax to write React components and how JSX is transpiled to JavaScript.

- State Management: Understand how to manage state within components using hooks like useState or this.state in class components.

- Props: Learn how to pass data and functions between components using props.

- Lifecycle Methods: Familiarize yourself with lifecycle methods in class components, such as   - componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount.

- Hooks: Master the usage of hooks like useEffect, useContext, and useReducer to manage side effects and shared state in functional components.

### 2. JavaScript and ES6+:

- Variables and Scoping: Understand variable declaration, scoping (var, let, const), and block scope vs. function scope.

- Closures: Learn how closures work and their practical applications, especially in scenarios involving callbacks or higher-order functions.

- Prototypes and Inheritance: Understand the concept of prototypes and how inheritance is achieved in JavaScript through prototype chains.

- Asynchronous Programming: Learn about promises, async/await, and handling asynchronous operations using the Fetch API or third-party libraries like Axios.

- Array Manipulation: Familiarize yourself with common array methods like map, filter, reduce, and spread syntax.

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: Gain knowledge of OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, as well as how to implement them in JavaScript.

### 3. React Router:

- Route Setup: Learn how to set up routes and define route components using React Router.

- Route Parameters: Understand how to define dynamic route parameters and access them within components.

- Nested Routes: Learn how to create nested routes and render components accordingly.

- Programmatic Navigation: Familiarize yourself with techniques to navigate between routes programmatically using history or Link components.

### 4. State Management:

- React Context API: Understand how to use the Context API to share state between components without prop drilling.

- Redux: Learn the principles of Redux, including actions, reducers, and the Redux store. Understand how to integrate Redux with React components.

- MobX: Explore the MobX library for state management and how to use observables, actions, and computed values.

### Component Libraries and UI Frameworks:

- Material-UI: Learn how to use Material-UI components, themes, and styles to create visually appealing and responsive UIs.
Ant Design: Familiarize yourself with Ant Design components and their customization options.

- Semantic UI: Understand how to use Semantic UI components and their semantic HTML markup for better accessibility and readability.

### 5. React Hooks:

- useState: Understand how to manage component state using the useState hook.

- useEffect: Learn how to handle side effects, such as fetching data or subscribing to events, using the useEffect hook.

- useContext: Master the usage of the 
useContext hook to access context values within functional components.

- Custom Hooks: Learn how to create custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic and share stateful behavior between components.

### 6. Data Fetching:

- Fetch API: Understand how to make HTTP requests using the Fetch API and handle response data.

- Axios: Familiarize yourself with the Axios library for handling AJAX requests and managing request/response interceptors.

- GraphQL: Learn the basics of GraphQL and how to use libraries like Apollo Client to fetch and manage data in React applications.
