/**
 * 
 * Challenge 2: Conditional Rendering and Event Handling
 * Build a toggle component that displays a toggle button. Initially, the
 * button should show the text "ON". When clicked, it should toggle between
 * "ON" and "OFF" with each click. Use conditional rendering to display the
 * appropriate text based on the current state. Implement event handling to
 * update the state and toggle the text when the button is clicked.
