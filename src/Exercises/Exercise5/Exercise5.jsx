/**
 * Challenge: Creating a Contact Form
 * Your task is to create a contact form component in React. The form should collect the user's name, email address, and message. When the form is submitted, the form data (name, email, and message) should be sent to a server for further processing or storage.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * Create a component called ContactForm that renders a form.
 * The form should have input fields for the user's name, email address, and a textarea for the message.
 * Implement state management using hooks (useState) to store the form data.
 * Validate the form inputs to ensure that the name, email address, and message are not empty.
 * Handle form submission by sending the form data to a server or displaying a success message.
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 
 * Create the ContactForm component as a functional component.
 * 
 * Use hooks (useState) to manage the form data state.
 * 
 * Implement form input fields for name, email address, and message.
 * 
 * Validate the form inputs to ensure they are not empty. You can display error messages if any field is left empty.
 * 
 * Handle the form submission by implementing a submit handler function.
 * In the submit handler function, send the form data to a server using an 
 * HTTP request (e.g., POST request) or display a success message if the 
 * server integration is not available.
 * 
 * Feel free to style the form using CSS or a UI library like Bootstrap to 
 * make it visually appealing.
 * 
 * Remember to break down the problem into smaller steps and use reusable 
 * components whenever appropriate. Test the form by entering valid and 
 * invalid data to ensure that it behaves correctly.
