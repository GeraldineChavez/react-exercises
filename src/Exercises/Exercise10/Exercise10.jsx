// Challenge: Building a Shopping Cart

// Your task is to create a shopping cart component in React. The cart should allow users to add products, view the total price, and remove items from the cart. The cart state should be managed in the parent component, and relevant data and functions should be passed down to child components.

// Requirements:

// Create a parent component, ShoppingCart, that manages the cart state and functionality.
// Implement state management using hooks (useState, useEffect) to store the cart items and total price in the parent component.
// Create a child component, ProductList, that displays a list of products and allows users to add items to the cart.
// Implement a child component, CartItems, that displays the added items in the cart and allows users to remove items.
// Pass the cart state and relevant functions from the parent component to the child components using props.
// Update the cart state in the parent component when items are added or removed from the cart.
// Calculate and display the total price of the cart based on the added items.
// Style the shopping cart components to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

// Instructions:
// Create the ShoppingCart component as a functional component.
// Use hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage the cart state and the total price.
// Implement a function to add items to the cart and update the cart state accordingly.
// Implement a function to remove items from the cart and update the cart state accordingly.
// Render the ProductList component within the ShoppingCart component and pass the add-to-cart function as a prop.
// Render the CartItems component within the ShoppingCart component and pass the cart items, remove-from-cart function, and total price as props.
// In the ProductList component, render a list of products and allow users to add items to the cart by invoking the add-to-cart function.
// In the CartItems component, display the added items in the cart along with their prices. Allow users to remove items from the cart by invoking the remove-from-cart function.
// Calculate the total price of the cart in the ShoppingCart component based on the added items and display it appropriately.
// Style the shopping cart components to create an appealing and user-friendly interface.
// Remember to handle loading and error states appropriately, and ensure proper error handling throughout the application.

// Good luck, and happy coding!
